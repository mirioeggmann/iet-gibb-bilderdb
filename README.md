=======

This is one of my school projects which is a website to upload, store and share your photos. 
I coded it in my 4th Semester for the Modul 151 in 2016. 
We had to build a website with php, jquery, html and css. As database we had to use mysql. 
No frameworks were allowed except Bootstrap, Materialize and JQuery. 
Furthermore we had to use a mvc framework of our school or build our own.
I build my own but there is a lot to improve because we hadn't long to finish the project.
Maybe I will upgrade the mvc of this project in my summer holidays.
First I will try to use Frameworks like CakePHP or Laravel to see how they build their oop mvc framework.
